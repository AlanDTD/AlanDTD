Trend analysis: plot average sentiment over time to identify improvements or declines

Seasonal patterns: group by month or season to see how sentiment varies throughout the year

Day-of-week effects: compare sentiment on weekdays vs weekends to spot scheduling issues

Correlation: examine links between sentiment and outage duration, size (customers impacted), or notice period

Anomaly detection: flag dates with unusually low or high sentiment scores for deeper investigation

Convert your date column to datetime:

python
Copy
Edit
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])
Extract the weekday name:

python
Copy
Edit
df['day_of_week'] = df['date'].dt.day_name()
Compute average sentiment by day:

python
Copy
Edit
mean_sent = df.groupby('day_of_week')['sentiment_score'].mean()
Order the days Mon‚ÜíSun:

python
Copy
Edit
mean_sent = mean_sent.reindex(['Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday','Friday','Saturday','Sunday'])
Plot a bar chart:

python
Copy
Edit
mean_sent.plot(kind='bar'); plt.xlabel('Day of Week'); plt.ylabel('Avg Sentiment'); plt.tight_layout(); plt.show()

how do i create a hypothesis and prove it statistic


ChatGPT said:

Thought for 4 seconds
Formulate hypotheses: e.g. H‚ÇÄ: Œº_weekend = Œº_weekday versus H‚ÇÅ: Œº_weekend ‚â† Œº_weekday.

Choose test & check assumptions: use an independent-samples t-test; verify normality (Shapiro‚ÄìWilk) and homogeneity (Levene‚Äôs).

Compute in Python:

python
Copy
Edit
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
t, p = ttest_ind(df[df.day_of_week.isin(['Saturday','Sunday'])].sentiment_score,
                 df[df.day_of_week.isin(['Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday','Friday'])].sentiment_score,
                 equal_var=True)
Decide: reject H‚ÇÄ if p < Œ± (e.g. 0.05), concluding a significant difference.

Report: provide t-statistic, p-value, effect size (Cohen‚Äôs d) and confidence interval for ŒîŒº.

what actionable insights can i draw


ChatGPT said:
Reschedule to mid-week: if you find Fridays or Mondays consistently have lower sentiment, shift planned outages to Tuesday‚ÄìThursday when customers feel less inconvenienced.

Enhanced weekend communication: when weekend work is unavoidable, send earlier or more detailed notifications (e.g. exact restoration windows) to boost weekend sentiment.

Targeted follow-up: for days with spikes in negative feedback, trigger post-outage surveys or customer service outreach to address specific concerns.

Adjust staffing & support: increase customer-care availability on days with historically poorer sentiment to respond quickly to issues.

Root-cause deep dives: flag dates/days with outlier low scores for a detailed review of notice periods, outage duration or messaging gaps.

i want to examine days as well if there's any day that sticks out more than others


ChatGPT said:

Thought for 4 seconds
Summarise by day:

python
Copy
Edit
stats = df.groupby('day_of_week')['sentiment_score'].agg(['mean','std','count'])
Visualise with a boxplot to spot outliers:

python
Copy
Edit
import seaborn as sns
sns.boxplot(x='day_of_week', y='sentiment_score', data=df, order=DAYS)
Run one‚Äêway ANOVA to test if means differ:

python
Copy
Edit
from scipy.stats import f_oneway
f, p = f_oneway(*(df[df.day_of_week==d]['sentiment_score'] for d in DAYS))
If p<0.05, perform Tukey‚Äôs HSD for pairwise comparisons:

python
Copy
Edit
from statsmodels.stats.multicomp import pairwise_tukeyhsd
tukey = pairwise_tukeyhsd(df['sentiment_score'], df['day_of_week'], alpha=0.05)
print(tukey)
Identify which days differ significantly and drill into their outage contexts.

I'm also looking for ways to examine the customer verbatims are they any tips? thanks


ChatGPT said:

Thought for 4 seconds
Here are some ways to dig into your verbatims:

Preprocess: lowercase, strip punctuation, remove stop-words and lemmatise to standardise terms.

Explore: build word-clouds or bar charts of top unigrams/bigrams (e.g. via WordCloud or CountVectorizer).

TF-IDF & clustering: vectorise with TF-IDF and cluster (K-Means) to group similar comments.

Topic modelling: run LDA or NMF to surface latent themes across all responses.

Contextual sampling: use KWIC/concordance (NLTK) or spaCy‚Äôs similarity to pull exemplar quotes for each theme and validate automatically discovered topics.






You said:
with the actionable of days of the week for planned outage is there a way to predict what type of improvements can i expect to see if we change  


ChatGPT said:

Thought for 4 seconds
Build a predictive model: e.g. an OLS or random‚Äêforest regression with sentiment_score ~ C(day_of_week) + other_covariates.

Estimate day effects: the model‚Äôs day_of_week coefficients give the expected Œî in sentiment when you switch from a low‚Äêscoring day to your target day.

Simulate rescheduling: ‚Äúre‚Äêscore‚Äù your historical outages by setting their day_of_week to the new day and predict their sentiment.

Aggregate uplift: compute the average (and total) sentiment gain across all moved events to quantify expected improvements.

Quantify uncertainty: bootstrap or Monte Carlo simulate your rescheduling to obtain confidence intervals around the projected uplift.

What is OLS


ChatGPT said:
Definition: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is a method for estimating the parameters of a linear regression model by minimising the sum of the squared differences between observed and predicted values.

Formula: For model

Key assumptions: linearity, independence of errors, homoscedasticity (constant error variance), no perfect multicollinearity, and (for inference) normally distributed errors.

Interpretation: Each coefficient

 , holding other variables constant.

Use cases: Widely used for both inference (testing hypotheses about relationships) and prediction in statistics and econometrics.

what other actionable insights can i derive from planned outages


ChatGPT said:
Notification Timing: Check sentiment by advance notice period to optimise customer communications.

Duration Impact: Identify the optimal outage length that minimises negative feedback.

Repeat Outages: Analyse sentiment for customers experiencing multiple outages‚Äîconsider targeted support or communications.

Geographical Analysis: Map suburbs with lowest sentiment to prioritise regional improvements.

Reason Analysis: Group sentiment by outage reasons, addressing those consistently linked to dissatisfaction.






You said:
i feel alot of actionable insights for planned outage is out of my control


ChatGPT said:
That's common. To focus on insights you can influence, try:

Communication Clarity: Refine messaging or SMS timing to better align with customer preferences.

Expectation Management: Improve accuracy of estimated restoration times (ERTs) or give clearer updates during outages.

Follow-up Actions: Implement proactive customer outreach post-outage for areas showing repeated dissatisfaction.

Tailored Messaging: Customise notifications or tips (e.g., preparedness advice) based on suburb or customer type.

Feedback Loops: Regularly share sentiment analysis with operational teams to gradually influence outage planning decisions.
