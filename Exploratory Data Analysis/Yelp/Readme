Content: 1,569,264 reviews of local businesses (e.g., restaurants, auto services, home services).
Metrics Analyzed: Star ratings, review lengths, positive and negative word counts, and votes marking reviews as useful.
Key Analyses
Star Ratings
General Sentiment: Reviews are primarily positive, with 67% rated at 4 or 5 stars. The mean rating is 3.7 stars, with a median of 4.

Review Length
Average Length: 125.6 characters, with most reviews between 48 to 165 characters.
Observation: Negative reviews tend to be longer than positive reviews, with one extreme case of 3,528 characters.
Sentiment Analysis
Positive vs. Negative Words: On average, reviews contain 6 positive words compared to 2 negative words, leading to a net sentiment that skews positively.
Word Distribution: Positive words show a more normal distribution, while negative words are right-skewed, suggesting reviews generally emphasize positive language.
Net Sentiment
Calculated by subtracting the count of negative words from positive ones. The net sentiment has a mean of 3.8, indicating an overall positive inclination in reviews.
Review Length vs. Usefulness
Correlation: Longer reviews receive more votes as useful, with a weak positive correlation of 0.33 between review length and usefulness.
Insight: Higher star ratings (4 and 5) tend to correlate with longer review lengths, showing that positive reviews are often more detailed.
Conclusion
The analysis shows that Yelp reviews generally favor positive sentiment, with longer reviews typically rated higher. Despite a weak correlation between review length and perceived usefulness, it is evident that detailed reviews are more frequently marked as useful by users.
